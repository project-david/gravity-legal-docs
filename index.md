Gravity Legal allows individual attorneys or firms to collect client payments for services rendered or funds designated for a trust or IOLTA account. Firms may accept payments either via credit/debit card or direct bank transfer using a Payment Link or Standing Link. A Payment Link is created for a client whereas a Standing Link may be used by any number of clients. Clients may also securely store payment method details in a Stored Payment Method for future payments. The diagram below shows this.
